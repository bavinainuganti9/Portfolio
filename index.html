            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey! My name is Bavina Inuganti, and I am an incoming sophomore at Rutgers University - New Brunswick majoring in computer science and data science. I am looking to use teamwork and people skills to apply experience in youth leadership in a technology environment, and apply my skills in real world applications. I plan to focus on Machine Learning and AI, and Finance, and begin a non-profit with an emphasis on uplifting low-income communities and minority groups into the workforce.</p>
